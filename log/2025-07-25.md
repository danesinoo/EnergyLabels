The accuracy with the previous model was so low, that I changed model into:
[Phi 3.1 mini 4k](https://huggingface.co/bartowski/Phi-3.1-mini-4k-instruct-GGUF)

The input is some text, I split it at the point. And I label it in the following
classes:
- `0`: no reference to any exchanger
- `1`: reference to exchanger 1
- `2`: reference to exchanger 2
- `3`: reference to exchanger 3
- `4`: reference to exchanger 4
- `multiple`: reference to more than one exchanger

Thus, if a sample has only 0 and 1, I can assume pd.NA for entries of exchangers
2, 3, 4. I can check whether the dataset I obtain is consistent.

I hope it is.
How can I build the model to predict these classes:
- I want to try the token model I already implemented
    - I classify each word
    - I average them and I get the value
    - Otherwise I take the word with the maximum value, and I discard the rest.
- Something with more context could be better
    - BERT to classify each sentence: `AutoModelForClassification` (or something)
    - It doesn't have the context of the sentence in the sentences, which might
      be very relevant.
    - I can look for something with a bigger context window.

Little presentation on the work done:
- go through the notes
- identify what and resume it
- add why, and how, briefly
- it should be around 10 min

- organization
- NER - a similar task
- Nested NER

Dataset:
Pattern-matching to find the word in the text that are also contained in the
labels. When that's the case, such word is labels as the label that contains it.

The model:
1. Tokenize the text
2. Neural network to identify the class of tokens' per word

Dataset 2:
Split text in sentences with ".".
Given the sentences and the labels, asked to a chatbot to indicate whether it
contains any information about which heat exchanger.

We want to concentrate on the first exchanger.
Thus, we build a model to understand whether the text is talking about one
exchanger or more than one exchanger?

And then we apply the nn to extract the label of only one exchanger, the rest of
the entry we ignore.
